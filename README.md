Pragmatic drag and drop is a low level toolchain that enables fast and successful usage of the browsers built in drag and drop capabilities, for everyone.

We have been working on Pragmatic drag and drop for about two years, and it is being used in [Trello](https://trello.com), [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) and [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence). We are looking forward to sharing it with you all soon.
