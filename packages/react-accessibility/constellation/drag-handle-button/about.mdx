<SectionMessage appearance="warning">
  This component does not use the <Code>@atlaskit/button</Code> component,
  because <Code>@atlaskit/button</Code> cancels <Code>mousedown</Code> events
  and prevents dragging from occurring. Instead this component uses a native{' '}
  <Code>&lt;button&gt;</Code> element.
</SectionMessage>

## Default

<Example Component={DragHandleButtonExample} />

## Small variant

A small variant is available through the `/drag-handle-button-small` entrypoint.

It is intended for experiences with very limited space to accomodate a drag handle.
It is not recommended for general use due to the small target size.

<Example Component={DragHandleButtonSmallExample} />

## Dropdown menu

This component can be composed with [Dropdown menu](/components/dropdown-menu).

Because the Dropdown menu provides a `triggerRef` you will need to merge it
with your own ref in order to use the trigger as the `dragHandle` in your
`draggable()` registration.
