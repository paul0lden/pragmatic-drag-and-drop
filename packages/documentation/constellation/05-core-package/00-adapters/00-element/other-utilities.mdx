## `blockDraggingToIFrames`

This optional utility disables the ability for a user to drag into an `<iframe>` element.

Scenarios where this can be helpful:

- When you are shifting the interface around in reponse to a drag operation and you don't want the
  drag to enter into an `<iframe>` (for example - when resizing)
- When you don't want the user to be able to drag into a `<iframe>` on the page (there could be lots
  of reasons why!)

```ts
import { combine } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/combine';
import { draggable } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/element/adapter';
import { blockDraggingToIFrames } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/element/block-dragging-to-iframes';

const cleanup = combine(
	blockDraggingToIFrames({ element }),
	draggable({
		element,
	}),
);
```

- This function sets `pointer-events:none !important` to all `<iframe>` elements for the duration of
  the drag.
- Once an `<iframe>` is disabled, it will only be re-enabled once the current drag interaction is
  completed (and not when the `CleanupFn` is called)
- This function currently does not watch for new `<iframe>` elements being adding during a drag
  operation.
