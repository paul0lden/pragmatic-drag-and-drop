The images have been separated into two separate folders to workaround CodeSandbox issues.

1. `./raw` contains the raw SVG files used.
2. `./processed` contains encoded SVG data URI strings exported from `.ts` files.

We use the processed images instead of the `.svg` files directly because CodeSandbox does not handle `.svg` imports well.
