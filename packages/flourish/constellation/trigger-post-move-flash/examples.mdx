import BasicFlashExample from '../../examples/basic';
import SectionMessage from '@atlaskit/section-message';

This function will cause an element to flash. This is a nice visual affordance to add to an item after it has finished being moved to make it clear where the item has finished.

<SectionMessage>

This function depends on:

- [`@atlaskit/motion`](/components/tokens): Atlassian Design System motion duration
- [`@atlaskit/tokens`](/components/motion): Atlassian Design System colours for the flash

<br />

This function is simple to implement on your own tech stack if you want to.

</SectionMessage>

```ts
import { triggerPostMoveFlash } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/flourish';

// trigger post move flash on an element after it has finished moving
triggerPostMoveFlash(myElement);
```

<Example Component={BasicFlashExample} />
