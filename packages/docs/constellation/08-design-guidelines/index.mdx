These guidelines provide an opinionated way to implement drag and drop experiences with Pragmatic
drag and drop for Atlassian interfaces. These guidelines work within
[web platform design constraints](./web-platform-design-constraints) for drag and drop, and aim to
optimise clarity and performance. Non-Atlassian consumers are welcome to use these guidelines, or
create their own visual language for drag and drop. The [core package](./core-package) does not have
any baked in design opinions, but some of the [optional packages](./optional-packages) embody these
design choices.

<SectionMessage appearance="discovery">

These design decisions are available in our [Pragmatic drag drop Figma UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/file/3E3rGPX4YHlVUP3cNyRykB/Pragmatic-Drag-%26-Drop-UI-Kit-(PDND)?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=4UwHqNt2ffApWviO-1)  (Atlassian only).

We plan on soon making this Figma public soon.

</SectionMessage>

Cards, lists, and other UI can often be dragged and reordered. Design clear and consistent drag and
drop experiences in Atlassian products following these principles:

## Which parts of an entity should be draggable?

As a starting position, if an entity is draggable (eg a card), then make the whole entity draggable.
If the entity has other interactive parts (eg buttons, dropdowns), then just make the drag handle
icon the draggable part of the entity.

Something to keep in mind is that making an entire entity `draggable` will prevent text selection
inside that entity (platform limitation)

## Show what is draggable

It should be clear to a user that an entity is draggable by using the following:

- a drag handle icon
- cursor changes
- background color changes

<SectionMessage>

Please also see our [accessibility guide](./accessibility-guide) which talks about our guidance for
placing an action menu trigger on draggable entities.

</SectionMessage>

### Drag handle icons

A drag handle icon helps people understand what is draggable. Use the `DragHandlerIcon` from
[@atlaskit/icon](components/icon) as your drag handle icon. Please use `"color.icon"` as the icon
color as it provides the greatest contrast for accessibility.

```tsx
import DragHandlerIcon from '@atlaskit/icon/glyph/drag-handler';
import { token } from '@atlaskit/tokens';

function App() {
	return <DragHandlerIcon label="Drag list item" primaryColor={token('color.icon')} />;
}
```

<SectionMessage>

Our [drag handle icon button](./optional-packages/react-accessibility) uses `"color.text"` as the
icon color (rather than `"color.icon"`) to align with other icon buttons in our system, and for
correct colors for different states. We expect this minor mismatch will be corrected during our
upcoming icon work.

</SectionMessage>

When dragging is a primary action of an entity, there should be a visible drag handle on the left
hand side of the entity at all times.

<Example Component={EntireEntityIsDraggable} appearance="showcase-only" />

If dragging is _possible_ on the item, but dragging is not considered a primary action (it is a
"delighter"), then you _can_ just show the drag handle icon on `focus` and `hover`.

<Example Component={HiddenDragHandle} appearance="showcase-only" />

When the drag handle is a delighter, it _can_ drop down to a minium of `16px` in width. Try to keep
the whole entity draggable so that the draggable touch target is greater than `24px x 24px`. `16px`
is the size of a `"small"` [@atlaskit/icon](components/icon).

<Example Component={SmallHiddenDragHandle} appearance="showcase-only" />

![16px needs to be reserved for the drag handle](/images/design-minimum-drag-handle-width.png)

When the drag handle is the only part of an entity that is draggable, it's touch target size should
be at least `24px x 24px` in size (which is the size of a [@atlaskit/icon](components/icon)). You
will see that the spacing of our example item has changed to give the drag handle more breathing
room.

<Example Component={UsingDragHandle} appearance="showcase-only" />

Some entities are considered to be "implied" to be draggable (eg cards, columns, tree items) and
these entities do not require a drag handle icon - although you can still add them. Implied
draggable entities should use background color and cursor changes to make it clear which part of the
entity is draggable, and there should be a strong preference to make as much of the entity draggable
as possible.

<Example Component={StandaloneCard} appearance="showcase-only" />

Sometimes, your drag handle icon should be a button for triggering actions too (see our
[accessibility guide](./accessibility-guide)). In those cases, please use our
[drag handle icon button](./optional-packages/react-accessibility).

<Example Component={EntireEntityIsDraggableWithDragHandleButton} appearance="showcase-only" />

### Cursor changes

Use `cursor:grab` as a signal that an entity is draggable. Only the draggable part of an entity
should have `cursor:grab`. So when a draggable is only draggable from a drag handle, only the drag
handle should have `cursor:grab`.

<Example Component={AllDragHandleVariants} appearance="showcase-only" />

When dragging is a secondary action, and the entity has multiple operations, it _might_ be
appropriate to delay the `cursor:grab` by `800ms`.

<Example Component={DelayedCursorChange} appearance="showcase-only" />

[You can implement this behaviour just using CSS](https://twitter.com/alexandereardon/status/1702192381007917452)
(no JS needed!)

```css
.item:hover {
	animation-duration: 0s;
	animation-name: change-cursor;
	animation-delay: 800ms;
	animation-fill-mode: forwards;
}

@keyframes change-cursor {
	to {
		cursor: grab;
	}
}
```

### Background color changes

The draggable part of an entity should have a background color change applied when hovering over it.

Please use the appropriate [hover token](components/tokens/all-tokens) for the entity.

Usually for a draggable entity you will be using:

- `elevation.surface` as the background color.
- `elevation.surface.hovered` on as the `hover` background color on the draggable part of the
  entity.

<Example Component={AllDragHandleVariants} appearance="showcase-only" />

For some situations it might be appriopriate to use a different color pairing. Please try to use a
`".background"` color token for the draggable entity, and a matching `".hovered"` token for the
hover.

## Give feedback during a drag

While an item is being dragged, it is important that you give clear feedback to the user about what
is being dragged, and what will occur when the user completes the drag.

### Drag previews

A drag preview is a representation of the item being dragged. Generally a drag preview is a picture
of the item being dragged around the page, and not the draggable item itself.

When an item is small and simple, the drag preview can be an exact copy of the item being dragged.
If an item is larger or more complex, you should simplify the drag preview.

Simplification suggestions:

- Use a maximum of three pieces of information in a preview
- Use a maximum preview size of `280px x 280px` to prevent
  [super low drag preview opacity on Windows](./web-platform-design-constraints)

#### Standard

Drag previews should generally be pushed away from the users pointer by `space.100` vertically, and
`space.200` horizontally.

```
{
  x: token('space.200', '16px'),
  y: token('space.100', '8px'),
}
```

<img
	src="/images/design-drag-preview-offset.png"
	alt="A drag preview of a list item with an offset"
	style="max-width: 400px; margin: 0 auto"
/>

#### Cards

Cards are to be dragged from the point they're grabbed from (no offset).

<img
	src="/images/design-drag-preview-no-offset.png"
	alt="A drag preview of a card with no offset"
	style="max-width: 300px; margin: 0 auto"
/>

### Cursor

Due to [web platform constraints](./web-platform-design-constraints), we have limited control of the
cursor during a drag operation. The cursor will generally be `cursor:default` during a drag
operation.

[More information about cursors](./web-platform-design-constraints#cursors).

### The draggable item

While an item is being dragged, the original item should stay in place and dim to `40%` opacity
(`opacity: 0.4`) while the drag preview is being moved around.

![A draggable item left in place during a drag](/images/design-dragging-item-in-place.png)

### Multiple-item drag previews

For multi-item drag previews, use a stacked appearance with a badge indicating the number of items
being dragged.

- **Four or more small items** such as list items should appear as a stacked preview under the first
  item. Less than four small items can appear separately where space allows (all items showing in
  the preview).
- **Any more than one large item** (card) should show as a stack with a badge indicating the number
  underneath.

![A stack of multiple cards being dragged across a board, with a badge indicating there are two cards being moved.](/images/design-multi-card-drag.png)

Implement with [native drag previews](./adapters/element/drag-previews), or use the
[Figma kit (Atlassian only)](<https://www.figma.com/file/3E3rGPX4YHlVUP3cNyRykB/Pragmatic-Drag-%26-Drop-UI-Kit-(PDND)?type=design&node-id=38-5065&mode=design>)
in designs.

### Drop placement indication

It is important to communicate during a drag operation, what the result of the operation will be.
There are two signals you can use to indicate drop placement:

1. Drop indicator (a line)
2. Background color (`color.background.selected.hovered`)

#### Drop indicator

The drop indicator line is used to communicate relative placement (for example, before or after an
item in a list)

![A list of items where one is being dragged over a new location. The location where the item would drop if released is marked with a blue line and dot. ](/images/design-list-drop-indicator.png)

A drop indicator line should have the following properties:

| Property                         | Value                     |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Stroke size                      | `2px`                     |
| Color                            | `"color.border.selected"` |
| Terminal diameter                | `8px` (`"space.100"`)     |
| Border radius on right hand side | none                      |

The terminal should bleed `4px` outwards on the left hand side of the target item. When this
bleeding is not possible due to UI constraints (such as the element appearing in a scroll container
which would cause the terminal to be cut off) then the terminal "bleeding" can be disabled and the
terminal can sit against the left edge of the entity

For stacked items, the line should appear in the middle of the gap between the items.

- [Edge detection package](./optional-packages/hitbox): determines when and where the drop indicator
  shows based on the location of the dragged item.
- [React drop indicator package](./optional-packages/react-drop-indicator): draw drop indicators

<Example Component={ListExample} appearance="showcase-only" />

A drop indicator line should _not_ be used when a draggable item is being dragged over a droppable
area where there is no relative placement possible (for example, dropping into an empty sibling
list).

![dragging over an empty column should not print a line](/images/design-board-background-only.png)

#### Background color

A background color change is used to communicate that an item will be placed within a particular
droppable area. Background color changes should be used when there are multiple possible areas of
the page a draggable item can be dropped on. The droppable area that the user is currently over
should have its background color changed. A background color change should also occur when a
draggable item starts in a droppable area, when there are multiple possible droppable areas.

![dragging over a populated column, where a line and background color change is being displayed](/images/design-board-background-and-line.png)

A background color change to communicate that dropping is possible should only be applied when a
user can perform a drop operation. Sometimes an entity (eg a column) only allows dropping on a
subset of that entity. Only the subset that allows dropping should have a background color change,
and only when the user is dragging over that subset. We don't want to have a situation where a
background color changes, but when the user drops, nothing happens.

Background color change animation details:

| Property         | Value                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Background color | `"color.background.selected.hovered"`                                              |
| Easing           | `cubic-bezier(0.15, 1.0, 0.3, 1.0)` (`import {easeInOut} from '@atlaskit/motion'`) |
| Duration         | `350ms` (`import {mediumDurationMs} from '@atlaskit/motion'`)                      |

When draggable items can only be moved relatively within a single container, then no background
color change should be used when the user is dragging something within the experience.

![A list being reordered, where only a drop indication line is being shown and there is no background changes](/images/design-list-drop-indicator.png)

## After a drop, show the item in its new position

After a drop, the drag preview disappears and the original item should to it's new location. To
improve clarity about what the user achieved, the background color of the moved item should flash
once it has been moved.

![A series of actions shown in four slides. Hover state is grey, the drag indicator appears once drag begins, upon drop the color of the item flashes blue, then returns to its normal color.](/images/design-drop-flash.png).

We have implemented this flash in our [flourish package](./optional-packages/flourish) for you to
use with any framework.

Background color flash details:

| Property         | Value                                                                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Background color | `"color.background.selected"`                                              |
| Easing           | `cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0)` (not available in `@atlaskit/motion`) |
| Duration         | `700ms` (`import {largeDurationMs} from '@atlaskit/motion'`)               |

## Provide accessible controls

<SectionMessage>

Be sure to see our [accessibility guidelines](./accessibility-guidelines)

</SectionMessage>

All draggable items should also have the ability to trigger the same outcomes using assistive
technology friendly controls.

## Visible drag handle icons

Please make drag handle icons visible (where possible) as this is a helpful signal for people that
an item is draggable.

### Action menus for move actions

If the item already has a more actions (…) menu, put the move actions inside of the menu. This
provides a keyboard accessible way to move items that doesn’t rely on mouse clicking and dragging.

![A Jira issue list view where a more actions button appears on the items. The button has three dots as a label ...](/images/design-more-actions-hover.png)

### Drag handle icon menus for move actions

If the entity does not have any more actions (…), make the drag handle icon into a menu button. When
triggered, the drag handle button opens a menu that allows the users to move the item.

![An issue details view in Jira. A drag handle icon appears at the left of the assignee field. It is focussable, and opens a menu with options to move the field up or down in the view.](/images/design-drag-handle-menu.png)

Use the [drag handle menu component](./optional-packages/react-accessibility) in code or the
[Figma kit drag handle menu (Atlassian only)](<https://www.figma.com/file/3E3rGPX4YHlVUP3cNyRykB/Pragmatic-Drag-%26-Drop-UI-Kit-(PDND)?type=design&node-id=38-2098&mode=design>)
in designs.

### Other alternative controls

If an individual item does not have the ability to trigger actions, provide other ways to access
movement controls on focus.

![A series of actions that allow users to focus on a group of items, then move or rearrange them. ](/images/desin-edit-order-alt.png)

## Trees

<SectionMessage appearance="information">
	This design pattern has not yet been converted into a spec. Please refer to the following tree
	example as our current design guidance.
</SectionMessage>

<Example Component={TreeExample} appearance="showcase-only" />

## Dragging multiple items

<SectionMessage appearance="warning">This design pattern is under construction</SectionMessage>

How to show when more than one element is selected to be dragged.

### Cards and boards

Use `color.background.selected` and `color.border.selected` to show the elements that have been
selected, then change to the typical background color at 40% opacity once dragging begins. This
shows where the objects are currently, and where they'll return if no drag location is chosen.

Because cards are larger, multiple cards should be stacked under the first card in the preview. Use
a badge to show how many items are being moved.

![A stack of multiple cards being dragged across a board, with a badge indicating there are two cards being moved.](/images/design-multi-card-drag.png)

Checkboxes are highly recommended to show when one or more items are selected.

<!-- TODO Fix example to match ideal design guide -->
<!-- TODO uncomment this once example is done:
Try selecting and dragging multiple cards in the board below for an example. -->

<!-- <Example Component={BoardExample} appearance="showcase-only" /> -->

### List items

Use the selected background color token to indicate which items have been selected. Use drag
previews as usual, with all items being dragged in a column in the order they’d appear when dropped.

![A list of draggable items where some are selected, shown in blue.](/images/design-multi-select-list.png)

For more than three or four items, show a badge indicating the number and an implied stack beneath
the top item.

<!-- TODO: Fix example to match ideal design guide -->
<!-- <Example Component={ListExample} appearance="showcase-only" /> -->
