At this stage we are using [entry points](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#package-entry-points) rather than exporting everything from the root of the package to ensure that _everybody_ gets the best possible bundle size without needing to rely on [tree shaking](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking).
