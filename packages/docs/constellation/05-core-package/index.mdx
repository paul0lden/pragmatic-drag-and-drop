The **core package** of Pragmatic drag and drop includes all the essential building blocks for any drag and drop experience. The **core package** is vanillaJS library (authored in TypeScript) that can be used with any view library (eg `react`, `svelte`, `vue` etc).

```bash
# install the core package
yarn add @atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop
```

Pragmatic drag and drop is optimised for performance. A key way this is achieved is by only requiring you include the code you actually use for your experience. Within the **core package**, there are many optional pieces, which are separated into their own entry points

For example:

- [The element adapter](./adapters/element): `/element/adapter` (`@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/element/adapter`)
- [An array reordering utility](./utilities): `/reorder` (`atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/reorder`)

And many more!

You can also use our [optional packages](./optional-packages) to streamline the building of your experiences if you want to. Some of these optional packages are tied to specific view technologies (eg `@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop-react-drop-indicator` uses `react` for rendering and `emotion` for styling), and those dependencies are made clear in the packages documentation. Where possible, packages don't have any dependency on a view technology (eg `@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop-hitbox` for hitbox information).

### Adapters

An _adapter_ teaches Pragmatic drag and drop how to handle dragging a particular entity:

- [element adapter](./adapters/element) → handling the dragging of draggable elements
- [text selection adapter](./adapters/text-selection) → handling the dragging of text selections
- [external adapter](./adapters/external) → handling drag operations that started outside of the current `window` (eg files and text from other `window`s or applications)

A drag adapter always provides at least two pieces:

1. A way of registering [drop target](./drop-targets) (eg `dropTargetForElements`).
2. A way to create a [monitor](./monitor) (eg `monitorForExternal`).

```ts
import {
  dropTargetForExternal,
  monitorForExternal,
} from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/external/adapter';

import {
  dropTargetForElements,
  monitorForElements,
} from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/element/adapter';

import {
  dropTargetForTextSelection,
  monitorForTextSelection,
} from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/text-selection/adapter';
```

An adapter can also provide additional pieces. For example, the [element adapter](./adapters/element) provides a `draggable()` function which is a way of registering a `HTMLElement` as being draggable.

```ts
import { draggable } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/element/adapter';

const cleanup = draggable({
  element: myElement,
});
```

### Drop targets

An `Element` that can be dropped upon by something that is dragging.

```ts
import { dropTargetForExternal } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/external/adapter';

const cleanup = dropTargetForExternal({
  element: myElement,
});
```

Learn more about [drop targets](./drop-targets).

### Monitors

A way of listening for `@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop` drag operation events anywhere.

```ts
import { monitorForElements } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/element/adapter';

const cleanup = monitorForElements({
  element: myElement,
  onDragStart: () => console.log('an element started dragging'),
});
```

Learn more about [monitors](./monitors).

### Utilities

Utilities are small helper functions for common tasks, which are included with the main drag and drop package (e.g. `once` for simple memoization, or `combine` to collapse cleanup functions).

```ts
import { combine } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/combine';

const cleanup = combine(
  draggable({
    element: myElement,
  }),
  dropTarget({
    element: myElement,
  }),
);
```
