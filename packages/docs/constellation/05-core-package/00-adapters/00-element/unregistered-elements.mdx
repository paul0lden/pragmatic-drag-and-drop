description: How the element adapter works with draggable elements that are not registered
---

Any `HTMLElement` can become draggable in the browser by adding the attribute `draggable="true"` to that element. Additionally, `<a>` and `<img>` elements are draggable by default (as if they had `draggable="true"` set on them).

The element adapter is only activated by explicitly registered elements (ie `draggable({element})`). The element adapter will not be activated by other draggable elements on the page.

If you want the element adapter to be activated by any element (including `<a>` or `<img>` elements), then you need to register it as a `draggable()`

```ts
import { draggable } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/element/adapter';

draggable({
  element: myAnchor,
});
```

## Disable default dragging of anchors and images

If you want to disable browsers default setting of `draggable="true"` on `<a>` and `<img>` elements, you can set `draggable="false"`

```html
<a href="/home" draggable="false">Home</a>
```

## External data for anchors and images

When dragging a `<a>` or `<img>` element, they will automatically attach some data for external consumers. For example `<a>` will attach `"text/uri-list"` matching the dragging URL.

Registering anchors or images as a `draggable()` does not impact this default assignment of external data

```ts
import { draggable } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/element/adapter';

// "text/plain" and "text/uri-list" external data will automatically be attached
// by the browser
draggable({
  element: myAnchor,
});
```

You can change the default external data values by using `getInitialDataForExternal()`

```ts
import { draggable } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/element/adapter';

draggable({
  element: myAnchor,
  getInitialDataForExternal: () => ({
    // overiding the standard "text/uri-list" value
    'text/uri-list': someOtherUrl,
    // adding some new value
    'application/x.something-custom': myCustomData,
  }),
});
```

## Drag previews for anchors and images

Browsers will automatically generate a drag preview when dragging `<a>` or `<img>` elements, even when those elements are registered as a `draggable()`.

You can control this drag preview in the same way you could any other element. See [drag previews](../drag-previews).
