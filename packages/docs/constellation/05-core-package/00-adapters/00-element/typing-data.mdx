title: Typing "data"
description: How to get better types for "data"
---

`dropTargetForElements` data (`getData()`) and `draggable` data (`getInitialData()`) is typed as `Record<string | symbol, unknown>`. A loose `Record` type is intentionally used as `dropTargetForElements` and `draggable` entities are spread out throughout an interface, and there are no guarentees that particular pieces are present, and what their `data` shape will look like (this is a similiar problem to typing form and field data).

```ts
dropTargetForElements({
  element: myElement,
  onDrop({ source }) {
    // `cardId` is typed as as `unknown`
    const cardId = source.data.cardId;

    // you need to check it's value before you can use it
    if (typeof cardId !== 'string') {
      return;
    }

    // handle drop
  },
});
```

A fantastic pattern that we recommend for _safe_ `data` types, is to leverage small helper functions.

```ts
// data.ts

// We are using a `Symbol` to guarentee the whole object is a particular shape
const privateKey = Symbol('Card');

type Card = {
  [privateKey]: true;
  cardId: string;
};

function getCard(data: Omit<Card, typeof privateKey>) {
  return {
    [privateKey]: true,
    ...data,
  };
}

export function isCard(data: Record<string | symbol, unknown>): data is Card {
  return Boolean(data[privateKey]);
}

// in other files

draggable({
  element: myDraggable,
  getInitialData: () => getCard({ cardId: '1' }),
});

dropTargetForElements({
  onDrop({ source }) {
    const data = source.data;
    if (!isCard(data)) {
      return;
    }
    // data is now correctly typed to `Card`
    console.log(data);
  },
});
```

A common approach for solving similiar problems is to enable the ability to provide generics to pieces to force it's `data` type.

```ts
// Note: this is not real API
dropTargetForElements<{ cardId: string }>({
  element: myElement,
  onDrop({ source }) {
    // cardId would not be typed as `string`
    const cardId = source.data.cardId;
  },
});
```

The trouble with this approach is that some pieces might not use the generic and so you can get runtime errors. Things also get complicated if you want a piece to handle entities with a lot of `data` types.
