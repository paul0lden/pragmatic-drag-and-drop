title: External adapter
description: Respond and listen to drag opereations that started outside the current window
---

import SectionMessage from '@atlaskit/section-message';

The external adapter is used to listen and respond to:

- drags that started from the users operating system (eg files)
- drags that started from other `window`s (including from child `<iframe>`s)

The external adapter consists of the following pieces:

- `dropTargetForExternal`: marking an element as a valid [drop target](../../drop-targets) for external entities
- `monitorForExternal`: create a [monitor](../../monitors) to listen for an external drag operation events anywhere
- `type`s: all types for this adapter

There are utilities for making working with particular external data types easier:

- [Files](./files)
- [URLs](./URLs)
- [Text](./text)
- [HTML](./HTML)
- [Custom media](./custom-media)

There are also some utilities for usage with any external data type:

- [some](#filtering-by-native-data-types): combine predicates and return `true` if _any_ predicate matches (eg `some(containsText, containsHTML)`)

<SectionMessage>

It is likely that some [top level utilities](../utilities/) will be helpful for your experience as well

## Drop target for external

A [drop target](../../drop-targets) for external data.

The default `dropEffect` for external drop targets is `"copy"`. This is because when you move data from outside of a `window` into the `window`, you are _generally_ making a _copy_ of the data. You can override this default with `getDropEffect()`.

```ts
import { dropTargetForExternal } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/external/adapter';

const cleanup = dropTargetForExternal({
  element: myElement,
  onDragEnter: () => console.log('Some external data was dragged over me');
});
```

## Monitor for external

A [monitor](../../monitors) for native drags.

```ts
import {monitorForExternal} from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/external/adapter';

const cleanup = monitorForExternal({
  onDragStart: () => console.log('An external drag has entered the window');
});
```

## Filtering by native data types

If you only want your drop target or monitor to be active when particular types of data is being dragged (eg files), then you can provide a predicate function to `canDrop` and `canMonitor`

```ts
import {dropTargetForExternal, monitorForExternal} from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/external/adapter';
import {containsFiles} from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/external/file';

dropTargetForExternal({
  element: myElement,
  canDrop: containsFiles,
  onDragEnter: () => console.log('A file is being dragged over me');
});

monitorForExternal({
  canMonitor: containsFiles,
  onDragStart: () => console.log('A file is being dragged');
});
```

If you want a drop target or monitor to listen for multiple types of native drag data, you can use `some()`. `some()` will return true if any predicate function returns `true` (the same as `Array.prototype.some`).

```ts
import {dropTargetForExternal, monitorForExternal} from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/external/adapter';
import {containsFiles} from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/external/file';
import {containsText} from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/external/text';

dropTargetForExternal({
  canMonitor: some(containsFiles, containsText),
  onDragEnter: () => console.log('A file or text is being dragged over me');
});

monitorForExternal({
  canMonitor: some(containsFiles, containsText),
  onDragStart: () => console.log('A file or text is being dragged');
});
```

You can also create your own predicate functions to facilitate your own bespoke checks.

## Events

The external adapter removes some events from the [standard event flow](../events).

- `onGenerateDragPreview` is removed from external _drop targets_ and _monitors_. For external operations the drag preview has already been generated externally.
- `onDragStart` is removed from external _drop targets_ as an external drag operation can _never start_ from inside a drop target in the `window`

If your drop target element needs to know when a drag is starting (ie a user is dragging a file into the browser), then you can use a monitor

```ts
dropTargetForExternal({
  element: el,
  onDragEnter: () => console.log('user is now over this drop target'),
  onDragLeave: () => console.log('user is no longer over this drop target'),
  onDrop: () =>
    console.log('user dropped on this drop target (or a child drop target)'),
});
monitorForExternal({
  onDragStart: () => console.log('file is entering the window'),
  onDrop: () => console.log('drag is finished'),
});
```

## Cross domain dragging and iframes

The external adapter enables you to drag data from one `window`, other web `window`s, or native applications.

Unfortunately, in `Chrome@122` and `Safari@14.3.1` it is not possible to drag something from a parent `window` to a child `<iframe>`, or from a child `<iframe>` to a parent `window` if they are on _different_ domains.

For clarity, the following is permitted by all browsers:

- dragging from one page to another browser tab on the same domain
- dragging from one page to another browser tab on a different domain
- dragging from one page native applications
- dragging from one page to a child `<iframe>` on the same domain
- dragging from a child `<iframe>` to a child `<iframe>` on the same domain
- dragging from one page to an `<iframe>` (on any domain) on a different browser tab (on any domain)

The following is not permitted on `Chrome@122` and `Safari@14.3.1`:

- dragging from one page to a child `<iframe>` on a _different_ domain
- dragging from a child `<iframe>` to a parent page on a _different_ domain

### Extracting data

Due to the web platform drag and drop security model, you can know what "types" are being dragging during a drag (eg `"text/plain"`), but you can only see what data is being dragged (exposed through `.items`) during a successful "drop" event (`onDrop()`).

```ts
import {
  dropTargetForExternal,
  monitorForExternal,
} from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/external/adapter';
import {
  containsFiles,
  getFiles,
} from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/external/file';
import {
  containsText,
  getText,
} from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/external/text';

dropTargetForExternal({
  canDrop: some(containsFiles, containsText),
  onDrop({ source }) {
    const files = getFiles({ source });
    const text = getText({ source });
  },
});

monitorForExternal({
  canMonitor: some(containsFiles, containsText),
  onDrop({ source }) {
    const files = getFiles({ source });
    const text = getText({ source });
  },
});
```

Generally, you will only want to interact with `source` using one of our helpers (eg `getText()`). `.items` and `getStringData()` only return meaningful information during a successful "drop" event (`onDrop()`)

`source.items` (`DataTransferItem[]`) will only be populated with data:

1. in the `onDrop()` event, and
2. when the user is dropping on a [drop target](../../drop-targets) (including when over a drop target due to stickiness)

Otherwise, `source.items` will be unpopulated (`[]`).

## Types

Generally you won't need to explicitly use our provided types, but we expose a number of TypeScript types if you would like to use them.

All [events](../../events) on drop targets and monitors are given the following base payload:

````ts
type ExternalEventBasePayload = {
  location: DragLocationHistory;
  source: ExternalDragPayload;
};

export type ExternalDragPayload = {
  /**
   * The media types that are being dragged during a drag.
   *
   * @example
   *
   * console.log(source.types);
   * // → ["text/plain", "text/html"]
   */
  types: NativeMediaType[];
  /**
   * The entities that are being dragged.
   * Usually you will not be using these directly, but
   * our helper functions can leverage them to extract
   * particular kinds of data (eg files) that are being dragged
   */
  items: DataTransferItem[];
  /**
   * returns the data for a given media type.
   *
   * - `getStringData(mediaType)` will return `null` if there is no data for that media type
   * - `getStringData(mediaType)` will return the empty string (`""`) if the empty string (`""`)
   *      was explicitly set as the data for a media type.
   * - `getStringData(mediaType)` will return null if requesting files (ie `getStringData('Files')`).
   *      To access files, use `source.items`, or better still, `getFiles({source})`
   *
   * Generally we recommend folks use our helpers to read native data rather than `getStringData(mediaType)`
   *
   * @example
   *
   * ```ts
   * // Using getStringData()
   * const text: string | null = source.getStringData("text/plain");
   *
   * // Using our text helper
   * const text: string | null = getText({source});
   * ```
   * */
  getStringData: (mediaType: string) => string | null;
};

type NativeMediaType =
  | 'text/uri-list'
  | 'text/plain'
  | 'text/html'
  | 'Files'
  | string;
````

For all the arguments for all events, you can use our event map type:

```ts
type ExternalEventPayloadMap = {
  onDragStart: ExternalEventBasePayload;
  // .. the rest of the events
};
```

Drop targets are given a little bit more information in each event:

```ts
type ElementDropTargetEventBasePayload = ExternalEventBasePayload & {
  /**
   * A convenance pointer to this drop targets values
   */
  self: DropTargetRecord;
};
```

For all arguments for all events on drop targets, you can use our event map type:

```ts
type ExternalDropTargetEventPayloadMap = {
  onDragStart: ElementDropTargetEventBasePayload;
  // .. the rest of the events
};
```

Drop target feedback functions (`canDrop`, `getData`, `getDropEffect`, `getIsSticky`) are given the following:

```ts
type ExternalDropTargetGetFeedbackArgs = {
  /**
   * The users _current_ input
   */
  input: Input;
  /**
   * The data associated with the entity being dragged
   */
  source: ExternalDragPayload;
  /**
   * This drop target's element
   */
  element: Element;
};
```

The monitor feedback function (`canMonitor`), is given the following:

```ts
type ExternalMonitorGetFeedbackArgs = {
  /**
   * The users `initial` drag location
   */
  initial: DragLocation;
  /**
   * The data associated with the entity being dragged
   */
  source: ExternalDragPayload;
};
```

You can get these type from the external adapter import:

```ts
import type {
  // The data that is being dragged
  NativeMediaType,
  ExternalDragPayload
  // Base events
  ExternalEventBasePayload
  ExternalEventPayloadMap,
  // Drop target events
  ElementDropTargetEventBasePayload,
  ExternalDropTargetEventPayloadMap,
  // Feedback types
  ExternalDropTargetGetFeedbackArgs,
  ExternalMonitorGetFeedbackArgs,
} from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/external/adapter';
```

There are also some types (eg `DropTargetLocation`) that can be used for all adapters which can be found on our [top level utilities page](../../utilities)

## Blocking unhandled external drags (`preventUnhandled`)

The default behaviour when dropping some external entities into a `window` (eg files) is for that entity to be opened in a new tab. Often, if you have drop targets for external entities on your page, you want drops outside of those drop targets to be ignored, and not to open a new tab. You an use the optional [`preventUnhandled` utility](../utilities) to help with that.
