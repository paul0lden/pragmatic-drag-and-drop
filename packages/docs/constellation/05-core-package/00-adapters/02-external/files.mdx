import FileExample from '../../../../examples/file';

## Accessibility

When handling file dropping, we recommend that you also add a native input for file uploads

```tsx
<input type="file" />
```

This will help enable folks leveraging assistive technologies to perform file uploads.

<Example Component={FileExample} appearance="showcase-only" />

## `containsFiles`

Useful to know whether file(s) are being dragged. Keep in mind that multiple pieces of native data can be dragged at once.

```ts
import { containsFiles } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/external/file';

dropTargetForExternal({
  element: myElement,
  canDrop: containsFiles,
});

monitorForExternal({
  canMonitor: containsFiles,
});
```

## `getFiles`

A helper to extract files from drop data. An empty array (`[]`) will be returned if there were no files being dragged.

```ts
import { getFiles } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/external/file';

dropTargetForExternal({
  element: myElement,
  onDrop({ source }) {
    const files: File[] = getFiles({ source });
  },
});

monitorForExternal({
  onDrop({ source }) {
    const files: File[] = getFiles({ source });
  },
});
```
