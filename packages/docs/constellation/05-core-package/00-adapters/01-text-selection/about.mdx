title: Text selection adapter
description: Listen and respond to the dragging of text selections in a document
---

import SectionMessage from '@atlaskit/section-message';

The text selection adapter allows you to listen and respond to text selections being dragged around in a `window`. Text selection is seperate from the [element adapter](../element) as text selections are not based on elements, but rather, whatever text the user has wanted to select.

The text selection adapter consists of the following pieces:

- `dropTargetForTextSelection`: marking an element as a valid [drop target](../../drop-targets) for text selection drag operations
- `monitorForTextSelection`: create a [monitor](../../monitors) to listen to text selection drag operations anywhere
- `type`s: all types for this adapter

It is likely that some [top level utilities](../utilities/) will be helpful for your experience as well

## Drop targets for text selection

A [drop target](../drop-targets) for text selection drag operations.

The default `dropEffect` for this type of drop target is `"copy"` as generally you will be copying dragged text. However, if that is not the case for your drop target, then please update it's drop effect through `getDropEffect()`.

```ts
import {dropTargetForTextSelection} from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/text-selection/adapter';

const cleanup = dropTargetForTextSelection({
  element: myElement,
  onDragStart: () => console.log('text started dragging in me');
});
```

## Monitors for text selection

A [monitor](../monitors) for text selection drag operations.

```ts
import {monitorForTextSelection} from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/element/adapter';

const cleanup = monitorForTextSelection({
  onDragStart: () => console.log('Dragging an element');
});
```

## Types

Generally you won't need to explicitly use our provided types, but we expose a number of TypeScript types if you would like to use them.

All [events](../../events) on drop targets and monitors are given the following base payload:

```ts
type TextSelectionEventBasePayload = {
  location: DragLocationHistory;
  source: TextSelectionDragPayload;
};

type TextSelectionDragPayload = {
  /**
   * The `Text` node that is the user started the drag from.
   * Note: the `Text` node does not include all text being dragged.
   * Use the `plain` or `html` properties to get the full selection
   */
  target: Text;
  /** The plain text of the selection */
  plain: string;
  /** the HTML of the selection */
  HTML: string;
};
```

For all the arguments for all events, you can use our event map type:

```ts
type TextSelectionEventPayloadMap = {
  onDragStart: TextSelectionEventBasePayload;
  // .. the rest of the events
};
```

Drop targets are given a little bit more information in each event:

```ts
type TextSelectionDropTargetEventBasePayload = TextSelectionEventBasePayload & {
  /**
   * A convenance pointer to this drop targets values
   */
  self: DropTargetRecord;
};
```

For all arguments for all events on drop targets, you can use our event map type:

```ts
type TextSelectionDropTargetEventPayloadMap = {
  onDragStart: TextSelectionDropTargetEventBasePayload;
  // .. the rest of the events
};
```

Drop target feedback functions (`canDrop`, `getData`, `getDropEffect`, `getIsSticky`) are given the following:

```ts
type TextSelectionDropTargetGetFeedbackArgs = {
  /**
   * The users _current_ input
   */
  input: Input;
  /**
   * The data associated with the entity being dragged
   */
  source: TextSelectionDragPayload;
  /**
   * This drop target's element
   */
  element: Element;
};
```

The monitor feedback function (`canMonitor`), is given the following:

```ts
type TextSelectionMonitorGetFeedbackArgs = {
  /**
   * The users `initial` drag location
   */
  initial: DragLocation;
  /**
   * The data associated with the entity being dragged
   */
  source: TextSelectionDragPayload;
};
```

You can get these type from the text selection adapter import:

```ts
import type {
  // Payload for the text selection being dragged
  TextSelectionDragPayload
  // Base events
  TextSelectionEventBasePayload
  TextSelectionEventPayloadMap,
  // Drop target events
  TextSelectionDropTargetEventBasePayload,
  TextSelectionDropTargetEventPayloadMap,
  // Feedback types
  TextSelectionDropTargetGetFeedbackArgs,
  TextSelectionMonitorGetFeedbackArgs,
} from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/text-selection/adapter';
```

There are also some types (eg `DropTargetLocation`) that can be used for all adapters which can be found on our [top level utilities page](../../utilities)
