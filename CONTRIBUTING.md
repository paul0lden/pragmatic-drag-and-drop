# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to Pragmatic drag and drop!

At this stage, we are not accepting code contributions. This repo is currently a one-way partial mirror from an internal monorepo at Atlassian. We might change this repo to be a two way mirror in the future, at which point code contributions would be possible.

At this stage contributions could take the following forms:

Leveraging Github issues for:

- Suggestions
- Bug reports
- Discussions

You _can_ raise a pull request if you would spot a bug / improvement and making a pull request would be a helpful way to demonstrate things. We will be able make our own changes to Pragmatic drag and drop, as inspired by these pull requests, but unfortunately at this stage we cannot directly merge those changes (nor attribute them properly in the Git history).
